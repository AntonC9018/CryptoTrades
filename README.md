Setup

1. Install .NET 7, Unity 2022.2.7f1 and either Visual Studio or Rider;
2. Select either Visual Studio or Rider as the default code editor in the Unity editor.
   Change it in Project Settings > External Tools.
   Either one of these is required to be able to generate the project files.
3. Run the command `build setup` in the root of the project (or `nuke setup` if nuke is installed globally).
4. Open `CryptoTrades.sln` from the root folder in your IDE.

> Note: the Unity project folder is one level deep
